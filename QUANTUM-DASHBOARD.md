## Educational Disclaimer

This dashboard is for educational purposes only. It demonstrates the application of quantum-inspired algorithms and machine learning to analyze lottery data. However, it's important to understand that lottery outcomes are fundamentally random and unpredictable. No algorithm, quantum or otherwise, can predict future lottery results with any advantage over random selection. This tool helps illustrate the mathematical principles and limitations of prediction in truly random systems.
